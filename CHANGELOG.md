## [3.2.1] - 2024-05-07

### Changed

-   Loosened dependency to `@arction/lcjs` to be allow anything between v5.0.0 and v6.0.0.
    -   This was done due experiencing many issues where NPM decided to interpret the dependency too restrictively, resulting in 2 installations of different LCJS versions, which further resulted in run-time errors.
    -   Users should manually ensure correct combination of LCJS and themes versions using the support table: https://github.com/Arction/lcjs-themes?tab=readme-ov-file#support-table

## [3.2.0] - 2024-04-10

### Added

-   `makeCustomTheme`
    -   Same as previous `makeFlatTheme` but allows enabling automatic gradients and effects for dark themes. These give much more depth to the generated themes.
-   `presetThemeDark`, preset example of new non-flat themes created with `makeCustomTheme`

### Deprecated

-   Deprecated `makeFlatTheme` over `makeCustomTheme`.
    -   `makeFlatTheme` still works but exists only for backwards compatibility reasons.
