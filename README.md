# Open-source Themes package for LightningChart JS

-   Provides tools and ready-made options for customizing LightningChart JS colors and styles
-   Helps with kicking off your own custom themes development by checking through the open-source repository
-   No need to wait for new LightningChart JS versions to get updates for themes, colorization and styling

## Usage

```sh
npm i @lightningchart/lcjs-themes
```

```ts
// Using pre-built open-source themes
import { flatThemeDark } from '@lightningchart/lcjs-themes'
import { lightningChart } from '@lightningchart/lcjs'

const chart = lightningChart().ChartXY({ theme: flatThemeDark })
```

```ts
// Creating customized theme using open-source theme factories
import { makeCustomTheme } from '@lightningchart/lcjs-themes'
import { lightningChart, ColorHEX } from '@lightningchart/lcjs'

const myCustomTheme = makeCustomTheme({
    isDark: true,
    fontFamily: 'Segoe UI, -apple-system, Verdana, Helvetica',
    backgroundColor: ColorHEX('#181818ff'),
    textColor: ColorHEX('#ffffc8ff'),
    dataColors: [ColorHEX('#ffff5b'), ColorHEX('#ffcd5b'), ColorHEX('#ff9b5b')],
    axisColor: ColorHEX('#00000000'),
    gridLineColor: ColorHEX('#303030ff'),
    uiBackgroundColor: ColorHEX('#161616ff'),
    uiBorderColor: ColorHEX('#ffffff'),
    dashboardSplitterColor: ColorHEX('#2d2d2dff'),
})

const chart = lightningChart().ChartXY({ theme: myCustomTheme })
```
